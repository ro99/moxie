# Moxie — mandatory agent entry point

This repository builds one NVIDIA inference engine for one interactive user, including models larger than VRAM and large context. It does not build independent engines per model.

## Read before editing

Read [README.md](README.md), [product boundaries](docs/spec/01-product-and-decisions.md), [common API](docs/spec/02-architecture-and-common-api.md), [agent playbooks](docs/spec/09-agent-playbooks.md), and the assigned milestone in [the roadmap](docs/spec/06-implementation-roadmap.md). Then read the relevant memory, attention/state, sampling/application and validation contracts linked there, and their actual legacy source references. These documents are normative; this short file is their discovery entry point.

Confirm writable repository root/branch/dirty state and read-only legacy snapshot before work. Preserve unrelated changes. Root policies apply to all subdirectories; local instructions may narrow but not silently weaken them. Keep shared policies, ADRs, task contracts and handovers version-controlled.

## Non-negotiable ownership

- Model definitions contain metadata, tensor roles and semantic graph composition. No model-owned execution loop, allocator/cache, CUDA/transfer code, scheduling, KV/branch lifecycle, sampling, speculation or collectives.
- Missing model mathematics becomes a shared semantic operation with an independent oracle and shape/precision/state/partition contract. Then the model consumes it. No opaque whole-model custom op or arbitrary backend callback.
- One real memory authority admits all persistent/transient/branch/draft resources; one state-transaction mechanism handles prefill, continuation, entropy and speculation. Event-retained leases govern asynchronous buffer reuse.
- Shared engine crates cannot import concrete models. Composition roots inject the registry. Kernel dispatch is by semantic capability/shape/layout/hardware, not model name. Architecture checks and affected-consumer tests are required.
- Rust owns the application/control plane. Reusing audited C++/CUDA kernels behind the common ABI is encouraged. Wrapping seven legacy generators is not a Rust rewrite of the engine.

## Product gates

- NVIDIA only; benchmark the two 3090s plus 5060 Ti and 251 GB host RAM. Never assume their memory is one allocation or their links equal.
- NVFP4 preferred, INT8 and BF16 canonical precision family. Exact logical format/scale contracts matter. No sub-four-bit weights or optional sub-16-bit cache. Intrinsic low-bit state ambiguity requires O4 resolution.
- Large actual context: 32,768 minimum useful target; larger tiers need positional, admission and execution evidence. Good prefill AND decode are simultaneous goals. Do not shrink context or hide one phase to pass.
- Quality is against the released model, not self bit-reproducibility. Numerical/quality gates must be declared before changing them. Never loosen a test to make an optimization pass.
- One active interactive generation; OpenAI-compatible API and CLI share the engine/sampler. Flash-style attention, TP, PP, speculation, common samplers and future entropy have shared contracts and truthful capability matrices.
- Do not silently drop samplers/features, lower precision/context, or run an unbounded fallback. `auto` reports selection; `required` errors when unsupported or inadmissible.

## Work and completion

Use [TASK.md](docs/spec/templates/TASK.md) for a bounded assignment; use the model and handover templates when applicable. Read [the source map](docs/spec/08-strata-reference-map.md) and pinned upstream references before inventing replacements. Extend existing shared ownership instead of copying a cache/runtime with small model differences.

Every task names the mechanism fixed, shared owner, consumers, source/oracle, resource and cancellation contract, acceptance tests and deletion/expiry plan. Run architecture/host tests plus relevant real GPU, topology, state, quality and paired performance gates. Report failed/skipped/unmeasured separately. No required feature is complete because it has a stub or flag.

Preserve negative experiments and remove superseded rewrite paths after replacement gates pass. Do not delete the legacy checkout. No bulk checkpoint conversion/download, system-driver change, network exposure or other material operational expansion without scoped authorization.

Open owner decisions O1–O7 are in document 01. Ask in a batch before dependent conclusions or work. Resolve normal technical choices through source, tests and measured ADRs; do not ask the owner to design kernels. A task cannot override an owner requirement through local inference.

If a requirement cannot be met, stop at its defined gate and report evidence plus the smallest decision needed. Do not manufacture completion with a private model path, hidden regression, test weakening or unsupported performance claim.
